Comments for Backpropagation.py module:

Update:
  Added 3 new functions that make up the forward propagation algorithm
    - It can take in a single row of data and pass it through a series of steps that is required to get a final output at the end of the network.
    - Please see the notes made in the Backpropagation.py module
    - Example Input:
      > [1 , 0, 3, -4]
     Example Output:
     > (fill this in Amiel)
    - Sigmoid function
      > Adds "Non-Linearity" in the model as that level of complexity is required to determine
        what value should and should not be passed
      > The function exists between 0 and 1 which is representative of probability
    - Example Output
      > [1.4765418851268763, 1.3714774431052756]
        Based on if the output layer had 2 neurons, hence 2 output values

  @Eric 
    - updated the other NN modules (utilizing the Convolutional method)
    - added the spider robot contorl script (QuadBotTestV3.ino)
